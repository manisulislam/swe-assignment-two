                "var" is the oldest way to declare a variable in JavaScript. Variables declared with "var" have a function-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they were declared. They also have "hoisting" behavior, which means they are accessible throughout the entire scope of the function, regardless of where they were declared. However, because of its function-level scope, variables declared with var can lead to unexpected behavior and are generally not recommended.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="text-danger"> let :</span> 
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "let" was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) as an alternative to "var". Variables declared with "let" have the block-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they were declared. They also have the concept of the temporal dead zone, which means they are not accessible before they are declared.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="text-danger"> const :</span> 
                <br>
                <br>
               
                
                "const" was also introduced in ECMAScript 6 and is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. This makes "const" variables useful for declaring constants, such as pi or the gravitational constant, which have a fixed value. Like "let", "const" variables have the block-level scope, and, they are not accessible before they are declared.</div>

                In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents the absence of an object. It is often used to indicate that a variable does not have a value or that an object does not exist. Null is not the same as an empty string or a zero value, as those values are still considered to have a value. Instead, null represents the absence of a value or object.

               <br>
                <span class="text-danger">Undefined :</span>
                <br>
                In JavaScript, undefined is a special value that is assigned to a variable by default when the variable is declared but no value is explicitly assigned to it. It is often used to check if a variable has been assigned a value or not.</div>

            <div class="accordion-body">A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.

                An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other. The API spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system or other application.
                
                A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service or REST API -- is based on representational state transfer (REST), which is an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.</div>
